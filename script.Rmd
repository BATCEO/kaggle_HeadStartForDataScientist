#   IT IS WHAT IT IS - Data Science ¿¿

Early days, When i was a newbie to the world of Machine Learning. 
I used to get overwhelmed by small decisions, like choosing the language to code with, choosing the right online courses, or choosing the correct algorithms.


So, I have planned to make it easier for folks to get into Machine Learning.

I’ll assume that many of us are starting from scratch on our Machine Learning journey. Let’s find out how current professionals in the field reached their destination, and how we can emulate them on our journey.

##  HOW IT CAN BE DONE !!

**Stage 1 - Commit Yourself**

For anyone starting out in Machine Learning, it’s important to surround yourselves with people who are also learning, teaching and practicing Machine Learning.

Learning the ropes is not easy if you do it alone. So, commit yourselves to learning Machine Learning—and find data science communities to help make your entry less painful.

**Stage 2 - Learn the Ecosystem**

**Discover the Machine Learning ecosystem**
Data Science is a field which has embraced and made full use of open source platforms. While data analysis can be conducted in a number of languages, using the right tools can make or break projects.


Data Science libraries are flourishing in the Python and R ecosystems. See [here for an infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis) on Python vs R for data analysis.

Whichever language you choose, Jupyter Notebook and RStudio makes our life much easier. They allow us to visualize data while manipulating it. Follow this [link](http://blog.kaggle.com/2015/12/07/three-things-i-love-about-jupyter-notebooks/) to read more on the features of Jupyter Notebook.

Kaggle, Analytics Vidhya, MachineLearningMastery and KD Nuggets are some of the active communityies where data scientists all over the world enrich each other’s learning.

Machine Learning has been democratized by online courses or MOOCs from Coursera, EdX and others, where we learn from amazing professors at world class universities. Here’s a [list of the top MOOCs](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/i-ranked-all-the-best-data-science-intro-courses-based-on-thousands-of-data-points-db5dc7e3eb8e) on data science available right now.

**Stage 3 - Cement the Foundation**

**Learn to manipulate data**

**Data scientists, according to interviews and expert estimates, spend 50 percent to 80 percent of their time mired in the mundane labor of collecting and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets. - Steve Lohr of New York Times**

‘Data Crunching’ is the soul of the whole Machine Learning workflow. To help with this process, the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) library in python or R’s DataFrames allow you to manipulate and conduct analysis. They provide data structures for relational or labeled data.


Data science is more than just building machine learning models. It’s also about explaining the models and using them to drive data-driven decisions. In the journey from analysis to data-driven outcomes, data visualization plays a very important role of presenting data in a powerful and credible way.

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library in Python or [ggplot](http://ggplot2.org/) in R offer complete 2D graphic support with very high flexibility to create high quality data visualizations.

These are some of the libraries you will be spending most of your time on when conducting the analysis.


**Stage 4 -  Practice day in and day out**


**Learn Machine Learning algorithms and practice them**

After the foundation is set, you get to implement the Machine Learning algorithms to predict and do all the cool stuff.

The Scikit-learn library in Python or the caret, e1071 libraries in R provide a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface.

These let you implement an algorithm without worrying about the inner workings or nitty-gritty details.

Apply these machine learning algorithms in the use cases you find all around you. This could either be in your work, or you can practice in Kaggle competitions. In these, data scientists all around the world compete at building models to solve problems.

Simultaneously, understand the inner workings of one algorithm after another. Starting with ‘Hello World!’ of Machine Learning, Linear Regression then move to Logistic Regression, Decision Trees to Support Vector Machines. This will require you to brush up your statistics and linear algebra.

Coursera Founder Andrew Ng, a pioneer in AI has developed a [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) which gives you a good starting point to understanding inner workings of Machine Learning algorithms.

**Stage 5 - Learn the advanced skills**


**Learn complex Machine Learning Algorithms and Deep Learning architectures**
While Machine Learning as a field was established long back, the recent hype and media attention is primarily due to Machine Learning applications in AI fields like Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, Language Processing. Many of these have been pioneered by the tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft.

These recent advances can be credited to the progress made in cheap computation, the availability of large scale data, and the development of novel Deep Learning architectures.

To work in Deep Learning, you will need to learn how to process unstructured data — be it free text, images, 
You will learn to use platforms like TensorFlow or Torch, which lets us apply Deep Learning without worrying about low level hardware requirements. You will learn Reinforcement learning, which has made possible modern AI wonders like AlphaGo Zero



# WHAT IT IS NOW,...
 
I see many new learners at Kaggle, though of making one kernal for them to have a head start.
This kernal for basic learners, is an attempt to get a quick understanding of Data Science, i picked regular conversation approch.
In kernal we will come accross two characters 'MARK' and 'JAMES' where MARK is new to Data Science (Laymen) and JAMES makes him understand concepts
 
 
For easy start i took,
dataset - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.


## Introduction.

On 14 April 1912, the [RMS Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) struck a large iceberg and took approximately 1,500 of its passengers and crew below the icy depths of the Atlantic Ocean. Considered one of the worst peacetime disasters at sea, this tragic event led to the creation of numerous [safety regulations and policies](http://www.gc.noaa.gov/gcil_titanic-history.html) to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again. Some critics, however, argue that circumstances other than luck resulted in a disproportionate number of deaths. The purpose of this analysis is to explore factors that influenced a person’s likelihood to survive.

 

### Software.
The following analysis was conducted in the [R software environment for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/).

 
**MARK**    - JAMES, What is that i am learning today?                                         
**JAMES**   - Basics of Data science.
 
**MARK**    - What is Data science?                                                                                  
**JAMES**   - Data science is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithmm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems.
 
**MARK**    - How do data scientists mine out insights?                                          
**JAMES**   - It starts with                                                                             
        1.Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem.                                                                            
        2.Process the data (data wrangling).                                                                           
        3.Explore the data (data visualization).                                                                            
        4.Perform in-depth analysis (machine learning, statistical models, algorithms).                                                                            
        5.Communicate results of the analysis.                                      
 

**MARK**    - James, could you please explain in elaborate.                                                                               
**JAMES**   - Yes, Here in 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster·'  we have a raw data set given. In general data is fetched from database

##Import library's, data
                                         
**MARK**    - How to import data set into Rstudio?                                         
**JAMES**   - Prior to loading data, library should be called for functions and specific algorithms


**MARK**    - Oh what if librarys are not called.                                         
**JAMES**   - Error message are thrown in R Console, on running functions/Algorithms

**MARK**    - Oh Gowd, i will mind calling library.                                                   
**JAMES**   - lets import library's.

```{r dependencies, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# data wrangling
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(stringr)
library(caTools)

# data assessment/visualizations
library(DT)
library(data.table)
library(pander)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(corrplot)
library(VIM) 
library(knitr)
library(vcd)
library(caret)


# model
library(xgboost)
library(MLmetrics)
library('randomForest') 
library('rpart')
library('rpart.plot')
library('car')
library('e1071')
library(vcd)
library(ROCR)
library(pROC)
library(VIM)
library(glmnet) 

```

**MARK**    - Now we can import data set.                                                                                                                               
**JAMES**   - Yes,

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

train <- read_csv('../input/train.csv')
test  <- read_csv('../input/test.csv')



```


**JAMES**   - For studing the complete data set lets join test and train data set.                                          
Before that we will add a new coloum "set" and give name as 'test' for test dataset                                          
and 'train' for train dataset to have an idea about which record it is.                                         

```{r , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

train$set <- "train"
test$set  <- "test"
test$Survived <- NA
full <- rbind(train, test)

```

**MARK**    - Are we done with Collecting the raw data needed to solve the problem?                                         
**JAMES**   - Yes, NextProcess the data.  

                                                                                  
                                         

**MARK**    - Why do we need to Process the data (data wrangling)?                                          
**JAMES**   - The data you have collected is still ‘raw data’,                                         
which is very likely to contain mistakes, missing and corrupt values.                                          
Before you draw any conclusions from the data you need to subject it to some data wrangling,                                          
which is the subject of our next section.We select the data what we want to do operation                                         



**MARK**    - What operations performed under data science?                                         
**JAMES**   - This is over all view .                                                                                  
<center><img src="https://doubleclix.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/data-science-02.jpg"></center>

**JAMES**   - This give a clear idea .                                                                                  
<center><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*2T5rbjOBGVFdSvtlhCqlNg.png"></center>


                                                                                  
                                         
**MARK**    -This look great, it shows even tools/programming language.                                          
**JAMES**   -In this kernal we will be using R programming language.                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                         
**JAMES**   -Before that we will have a look-into data - Exploratory Analysis                                                                                                                           
1. Check for data how it is scattered                                                                                   
2.dataset dimensions                                                                                  
3.columns names                                           
4.How many unique values are there in each row                                         
4. Missing values  etc                                                                                   
lets do str, names, summary, glimpse,                                                                                                                             

```{r , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}

## Feature engineering.

**MARK**    -  What is  feature engineering?                                                                                
**JAMES**   -  This process attempts to create additional relevant features from the existing raw features in the data,
and to increase the predictive power of the learning algorithm. 

To get an idea on feature enginering technique reffer - https://github.com/bobbbbbi/Machine-learning-Feature-engineering-techniques

## Data manupulation

**MARK**    - So we know how our dataset?                                                                               
**JAMES**   - Then we start doing with data manupulation.                                                                                    


**MARK**    -  What is data manupulation?                                                                                 
**JAMES**   -  Data manipulation is the process of changing data in an effort to make it easier to read or be more organized.                                            

                                                                                  
 The following section focuses on preparing the data so that it can be used for study, such as exploratory data analysis and modeling fitting.

### Age

Replace missing Age cells with the mean Age of all passengers on the Titanic.

```{r age, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=9}

full <- full %>%
    mutate(
      Age = ifelse(is.na(Age), mean(full$Age, na.rm=TRUE), Age),
      `Age Group` = case_when(Age < 13 ~ "Age.0012", 
                                 Age >= 13 & Age < 18 ~ "Age.1317",
                                 Age >= 18 & Age < 60 ~ "Age.1859",
                                 Age >= 60 ~ "Age.60Ov"))

```

### Embarked

Use the most common code to replace NAs in the *Embarked* feature.

```{r pp_embarked, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=9}

full$Embarked <- replace(full$Embarked, which(is.na(full$Embarked)), 'S')

```

### Titles

Extract an individual's title from the *Name* feature.

```{r pp_titles, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=9}



names <- full$Name
title <-  gsub("^.*, (.*?)\\..*$", "\\1", names)

full$title <- title

table(title)

  
###MISS, Mrs, Master and Mr are taking more numbers

###Better to group Other titles into bigger basket by checking gender and survival rate to aviod any overfitting


full$title[full$title == 'Mlle']        <- 'Miss' 
full$title[full$title == 'Ms']          <- 'Miss'
full$title[full$title == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs' 
full$title[full$title == 'Lady']          <- 'Miss'
full$title[full$title == 'Dona']          <- 'Miss'

## I am afraid creating a new varible with small data can causes a overfit
## However, My thinking is that combining below feauter into original variable may loss some predictive power as they are all army folks, doctor and nobel peoples 

full$title[full$title == 'Capt']        <- 'Officer' 
full$title[full$title == 'Col']        <- 'Officer' 
full$title[full$title == 'Major']   <- 'Officer'
full$title[full$title == 'Dr']   <- 'Officer'
full$title[full$title == 'Rev']   <- 'Officer'
full$title[full$title == 'Don']   <- 'Officer'

full$title[full$title == 'the Countess']   <- 'Officer'
full$title[full$title == 'Jonkheer']   <- 'Officer'  

```

### Family Groups

Families are binned into a discretized feature based on family member count.

```{r pp_familygrp, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=9}

full$FamilySize <-full$SibSp + full$Parch + 1 
full$FamilySized[full$FamilySize == 1] <- 'Single' 
full$FamilySized[full$FamilySize < 5 & full$FamilySize >= 2] <- 'Small' 
full$FamilySized[full$FamilySize >= 5] <- 'Big' 
full$FamilySized=as.factor(full$FamilySized)

         
```

###Tickets
Engineer features based on all the passengers with the same ticket.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

##Engineer features based on all the passengers with the same ticket
ticket.unique <- rep(0, nrow(full))
tickets <- unique(full$Ticket)

for (i in 1:length(tickets)) {
  current.ticket <- tickets[i]
  party.indexes <- which(full$Ticket == current.ticket)
  
  
  for (k in 1:length(party.indexes)) {
    ticket.unique[party.indexes[k]] <- length(party.indexes)
  }
}

full$ticket.unique <- ticket.unique


full$ticket.size[full$ticket.unique == 1]   <- 'Single'
full$ticket.size[full$ticket.unique < 5 & full$ticket.unique>= 2]   <- 'Small'
full$ticket.size[full$ticket.unique >= 5]   <- 'Big'

```



### Independent Variable/Target

### Survival

The independent variable, *Survived*, is labeled as a *Bernoulli trial* where a passenger or crew member surviving is encoded with the value of 1. Among observations in the train set, approximately 38% of passengers and crew survived.

```{r iv, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

full <- full %>%
  mutate(Survived = case_when(Survived==1 ~ "Yes", 
                              Survived==0 ~ "No"))

crude_summary <- full %>%
  filter(set=="train") %>%
  select(PassengerId, Survived) %>%
  group_by(Survived) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n))

crude_survrate <- crude_summary$freq[crude_summary$Survived=="Yes"]

kable(crude_summary, caption="2x2 Contingency Table on Survival.", format="markdown")

```

##Exploratory data analysis
**MARK**  - What is exploratory data analysis?                                                                                                       
**JAMES** - Data science is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithmm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems.                                                   


In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

### Interactive Relationships Between Variables

#### Correlation Plot

**MARK**    -  What is Correlation Plot?                                                                                 
**JAMES**   -  The corrplot package is a graphical display of a correlation matrix, confidence interval. It also contains some algorithms to do matrix reordering. In addition, corrplot is good at details, including choosing color, text labels, color labels, layout, etc.


Correlation measures between numeric features suggest redundant information such as *Fare* with *Pclass*. This relationship, however, may be distorted due to passengers who boarded as a family where *Fare* represents the sum of a family's total cost.

```{r corrplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}

tbl_corr <- full %>%
  filter(set=="train") %>%
  select(-PassengerId, -SibSp, -Parch) %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>%
  cor(use="complete.obs") %>%
  corrplot.mixed(tl.cex=0.85)

```

#### Mosaic Plot

**MARK**    -  What is Mosaic Plot?                                                                                 
**JAMES**   -  Mosaic plot (also known as Marimekko diagrams) is a graphical method for visualizing data from two or more qualitative variables. It is the multidimensional extension of spineplots, which graphically display the same information for only one variable.


```{r mosaicplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4, fig.width=9}

tbl_mosaic <- full %>%
  filter(set=="train") %>%
  select(Survived, Pclass, Sex, AgeGroup=`Age Group`, title, Embarked, `FamilySize`) %>%
  mutate_all(as.factor)

mosaic(~Pclass+Sex+Survived, data=tbl_mosaic, shade=TRUE, legend=TRUE)

```

#### Alluvial Diagram

**MARK**    -  What is Alluvial Diagram?                                                                                 
**JAMES**   -  Alluvial diagrams are a type of flow diagram originally developed to represent changes in network structure over time. In allusion to both their visual appearance and their emphasis on flow, alluvial diagrams are named after alluvial fans that are naturally formed by the soil deposited from streaming water.

Likelihood to survive was lowest among third class passengers; however, their chances for survival improved when *Sex* was female. Surprisingly, half of toddlers and adolescents perished. A plausible explanation for this could be that many of these children who perished came from larger families as suggested in the conditional inference tree model below.

```{r alluvial, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=9}
library(alluvial)

tbl_summary <- full %>%
  filter(set=="train") %>%
  group_by(Survived, Sex, Pclass, `Age Group`, title) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>% 
  ungroup %>%
  na.omit
  
alluvial(tbl_summary[, c(1:4)],
         freq=tbl_summary$N, border=NA,
         col=ifelse(tbl_summary$Survived == "Yes", "blue", "gray"),
         cex=0.65,
         ordering = list(
           order(tbl_summary$Survived, tbl_summary$Pclass==1),
           order(tbl_summary$Sex, tbl_summary$Pclass==1),
           NULL,
           NULL))
```

**MARK**    -  What is Machine learning?                                                                                 
**JAMES**   -  Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

**MARK**    -  What is Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning?                                                                                 
**JAMES**   -                                                                                                                                                                  
**Supervised Learning** - Supervised learning is a data mining task of inferring a function from labeled training data.The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and the desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).
    A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a “reasonable” way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
**Unsupervised Learning** - In data mining or even in data science world, the problem of an unsupervised learning task is trying to find hidden structure in unlabeled data. Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no error or reward signal to evaluate a potential solution.

**MARK**    -  So, now we will be doing Supervised machine learning?                                                                                 
**JAMES**   -  Yes, it is Supervised machine learning as we want to predict survival of passanger.
    
**MARK**    -  What is algorithms are we going to use in Supervisedmachine learning?

**Training Set** - In machine learning, a training set is a dataset used to train a model.  In training the model, specific features are picked out from the training set.  These features are then incorporated into the model. 

**Test Set** - The test set is a dataset used to measure how well the model performs at making predictions on that test set

**JAMES**   - Let’s do training with algorithms.                                                                                                                  


**MARK**    - After training with algorithms,  what’s next ?                                                                                                                                                                   
**JAMES**   - We have to validate our trained algorithms with test data set.

**JAMES**   - With [goodness of fit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_of_fit),  lets go with Confusion Matrix for validation.

#####Accuracy is 0.8375
####Not at all bad using Single tree and just 3 feauters

##There is chance of overfitting in Single tree, So I will go for cross validation using '10 fold techinque'

set.seed(1234)

##Check the accurcay
##Accurcay using 10 fold cross validation of Single tree is 0.8139 
##Seems Overfitted earlier using Single tree, there our accurcay rate is 0.83

# check the variable imporatnce, is it the same as in Single tree?
rpart.plot(Model_CDT$finalModel,extra =  3,fallen.leaves = T)

##Yes, there is no change in the imporatnce of variable




###Lets cross validate the accurcay using data that kept aside for testing purpose
PRE_VDTS=predict(Model_CDT$finalModel,newdata=test_val,type="class")

####Accurcay of test data using Non Liner model is 0.81
####it could be due to we are using smaller set of sample for testing data
```

#### Logistic Regression {-}

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

contrasts(train_val1$Sex)
contrasts(train_val1$Pclass)

##The above shows how the varible coded among themself

##Lets run Logistic regression model
log.mod <- glm(Survived ~ ., family = binomial(link=logit), 
               data = train_val1)
###Check the summary
summary(log.mod)
confint(log.mod)

###Predict train data
train.probs <- predict(log.mod, data=train_val1,type =  "response")
table(train_val1$Survived,train.probs>0.5)

(395+204)/(395+204+70+45)

###Logistic regression predicted train data with accuracy rate of 0.83 

test.probs <- predict(log.mod, newdata=test_val1,type =  "response")
table(test_val1$Survived,test.probs>0.5)

(97+47)/(97+12+21+47)

###Accuracy rate of test data is 0.8135
